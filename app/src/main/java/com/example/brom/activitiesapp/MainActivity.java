        //    "activity_mountaindetails". MountainDetailsActivity must have MainActivity as its
        //    ´parent activity.
        // 4. The layout file created in step 3 must have a LinearLayout
        // 5. The layout file created in step 3 must be able to display
        //    * Mountain Name
        //    * Mountain Location
        //    * Mountain Height
        // 6. When tapping on a list item: create an Intent that includes
        //    * Mountain Name
        //    * Mountain Location
        //    * Mountain Height
        // 7. Display the MountainDetailsActivity with the data from the Intent created in step
        //    6
        // 8. From the MountainDetailsActivity you should have an option to "go back" using an
        //    left arro button. This is done by letting the MainActivity be the parent activity to
        //    MountainDetailsActivity.
